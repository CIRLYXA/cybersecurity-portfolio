# Cybersecurity Portfolio  

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repository showcases hands-on labs and projects covering various tools, techniques and best practices in information security.  

## Repository Structure  

- **labs/** – practical exercises and experiments.  
  - **kali-linux/** – notes, scripts and results from Kali Linux based labs.  
  - **wireshark-captures/** – packet capture files and analysis using Wireshark.  
- **projects/** – larger, more comprehensive projects.  
  - **network-diagrams/** – network diagrams and architecture documentation for projects.  

## Getting Started  

Each subfolder includes its own README with instructions or context. To explore, navigate into a folder and review its contents.  

## Goals  

This portfolio is intended to demonstrate my proficiency in cybersecurity concepts, including penetration testing, network analysis, and secure architecture design. Over time, I'll add more labs, captures and projects.
